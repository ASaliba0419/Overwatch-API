### Strengths: I feel confident in my ability to create this API and implement its cool unique features.


### Weaknesses: Some weaknesses of mine would be having to make sure the user can delete only what the user has created.


### Opportunities: I feel this project is giving me the opportunity to really seal in the lessons from the past two weeks. To make sure I understand and comprehend all that is happening. I feel this will give me another opportunity to learn and solidify CSS working with React Components.


### Threats: I am the biggest threat to myself. I tend to procrastinate if I don't know how to do something. Lately, I have been teaching myself to fix this. If this does happen in this project I will continue to do research until I understand and can perform the action without procrastinating.
